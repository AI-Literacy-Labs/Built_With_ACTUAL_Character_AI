# Built_With_ACTUAL_Character_AI
Building a safety-first AI companion application in response to Character.AI's November 25, 2025 ban on under-18 users. The platform is specifically designed for vulnerable populations (autistic children, individuals with social anxiety) who lost access to Character.AI and need a safer alternative.
